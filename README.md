# Localized EmulationStation

This is a localized fork of [Retropie's EmulationStation fork](https://github.com/RetroPie/EmulationStation).

Inspired by similar work on the Recalbox fork.

Don't use this version, I just forked it to disable some menu on my system.

## How to add a translation

> You should have, at least, [created a clone from GitHub](#create-a-clone-from-github) before continuing with the following steps.

### Create files for the new locale

```
cd /home/pi/EmulationStation/locale
mkdir lang/[your_locale]
cp emulationstation2.pot lang/[your_locale]/emulationstation2.po
```

### Translate the strings

Open the newly created `emulationstation2.po` inside `[your_locale]` folder and start translating all the `msgstr` strings.

Once you are done, you can [compile EmulationStation](#compile-emulationstation) and then [run](#run-emulationstation) it to test your translations.
